# Attendance Tracker

Implemented by Zach Nett, 2019.

This is an implementation of an Attendance Tracker program using dynamic data structures for CptS 122 at Washington State University.

## Built Using

* Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 
* Visual Studio Code + many extensions/plugins
* macOS Mojave and Windows 10 Pro

## Installing

Add files to a Visual Studio C++ project and compile/run it, or otherwise compile using your favorite compiler (tested using G++).

## Notes

Note compatibility of most recent commit is geared towards Windows usage, though minimal edits should allow usage on macOS as well.

Also note that main menu functions need to be further compartimentalized into functions within the Menu class -- that has yet to be done, and thus main.cpp appears untidy.
